Development tools to help implement multi step forms.

### Usage

You can import the generated bundle to use the whole library generated by this starter:

```javascript
import myLib from 'mylib'
```

Additionally, you can import the transpiled modules from `dist/lib` in case you have a modular library:

```javascript
import something from 'mylib/dist/lib/something'
```

### Dependancies
 - Built with **[Typescript-Library-Starter](https://github.com/alexjoverm/typescript-library-starter)**
 - **[RollupJS](https://rollupjs.org/)** for multiple optimized bundles following the [standard convention](http://2ality.com/2017/04/setting-up-multi-platform-packages.html) and [Tree-shaking](https://alexjoverm.github.io/2017/03/06/Tree-shaking-with-Webpack-2-TypeScript-and-Babel/)
 - Tests, coverage and interactive watch mode using **[Jest](http://facebook.github.io/jest/)**
 - **[Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)** and **[TSLint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/)** for code formatting and consistency
 - **Docs automatic generation and deployment** to `gh-pages`, using **[TypeDoc](http://typedoc.org/)**
 - **[Travis](https://travis-ci.org)** integration and **[Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/)** report
 - **Automatic releases and changelog**, using [Semantic release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release), [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli), [Conventional changelog](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog) and [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) (for the git hooks)

## Contributing

### NPM scripts

 - `npm t`: Run test suite
 - `npm start`: Run `npm run build` in watch mode
 - `npm run test:watch`: Run test suite in [interactive watch mode](http://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/cli.html#watch)
 - `npm run test:prod`: Run linting and generate coverage
 - `npm run build`: Generate bundles and typings, create docs
 - `npm run lint`: Lints code
 - `npm run commit`: Commit using conventional commit style ([husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) will tell you to use it if you haven't :wink:)

### Excluding peerDependencies

On library development, one might want to set some peer dependencies, and thus remove those from the final bundle. You can see in [Rollup docs](https://rollupjs.org/#peer-dependencies) how to do that.

Good news: the setup is here for you, you must only include the dependency name in `external` property within `rollup.config.js`. For example, if you want to exclude `lodash`, just write there `external: ['lodash']`.

### FAQ

#### `Array.prototype.from`, `Promise`, `Map`... is undefined?

TypeScript or Babel only provides down-emits on syntactical features (`class`, `let`, `async/await`...), but not on functional features (`Array.prototype.find`, `Set`, `Promise`...), . For that, you need Polyfills, such as [`core-js`](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js) or [`babel-polyfill`](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/polyfill/) (which extends `core-js`).

For a library, `core-js` plays very nicely, since you can import just the polyfills you need:

```javascript
import "core-js/fn/array/find"
import "core-js/fn/string/includes"
import "core-js/fn/promise"
...
```
